    * Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of your `streamlit_pdf_summarizer` project directory (same level as `app.py`).
    * Add your API key to the `.env` file:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    * **Important:** Make sure to add `/ .env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent your API key from being committed to your public repository.
